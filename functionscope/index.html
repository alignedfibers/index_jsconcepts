      Function Scope in JS

      <div class="col-left">
        Function Scope is what allows the closure pattern and allows the use of global variables without redeclaring them
        within a nested function. When considering how function scope works, we have to first consider the root-scope,
        root-scope is the very top level scope where all of the global variables reside, within this scope we are able to
        create addittional scopes that branch off, providing a tree like structure. Each time a function is called it creates
        a new scope, this is called function scope, it's ancestor "lexical scope" refers to the parent scopes. Any variable
        declared within a function scope is local to that function and accessable to all child functions nested to any level.
        These variables declared within a function are not accessable to any of the parents unless explicitly exposed on an object
        within the parent scope, or exposed on the global object "root-scope". In your browser the root-scope is most likely the
        window object. If you are using nodejs or are using javscript within a pdf or other structure, the root-scope or great grandpa
        of all scopes will be the object provided in that structure and when referencing it directly, you may use a different name
        than "window". The root-scope is accessable to all children. If window is redeclared in the child function you will no longer
        be able to access the window object available at the root-scope level - I will talk about this, execution context and "this"
        more in a later demo about javascipt objects, which will allow us to demonstrate better. So, what is Function Scope, and how
        does it work? The answer is: Each function execution has it's own variables and functions declared with var or the function statement,
        if a specific function or variable you are looking for does not reside (is not declared) within the function where it was
        called or accessed, the javascript engine then looks for the variable in each parent scope until it reaches the root-scope
        before throwing an exception if it does not exist. Keep in mind that by keeping your variables declared locally, the
        "lexical analyzer" or javscript engine does not have to crawl up the scope tree, and your code will have a performance
        improvement. The two examples here will demonstrate using a variable locally defined within a function and using a variable
        defined within a parent function. This concept should help when attempting to grasp how closure, callback, immediately-invoked
        function expression, and anonymous function work.
